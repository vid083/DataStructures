Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170}
          x = 110;
Output : Element x is present at index 6

Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50, 110, 100, 130, 170}
           x = 175;
Output : Element x is not present in arr[]


Approach:-
1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2. If x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return-not present.

Time complexity:- if element Found at last  O(n) to O(1).

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms 
such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables allow significantly 
faster-searching comparison to Linear search
