## Bubble Sorting
 
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Bubble sort is a stable sorting (which does not change the elements positions randomly if they are same)

Bubble sort is a great example of quadratic time complexity O(n2) since for each value it needs to compare to all other values in the list - (two loops)
